### Design and Implementation of a Feedback System for One-Legged Series Elastic Actuated (SEA) Robot


#### A series elastic actuator can store energy in a compliant element such as a spring to facilitate
locomotion and jumping abilities. Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) have unique features because
of the elastic element, such as the capacity to store and release energy, tolerance to impact loads,
and low mechanical output impedance. These advantages were tested using a feedback system
consisting of a pulley system, belt, and an encoder to read deflection in the compliant element
for a series elastic actuator robotic legs. The Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), as a passive compliance
actuator, was utilized to control the motion and force of a kangaroo and cheetahâ€™s robotic
legs to provide a feedback system to compare the efficiency and stability. The feedback system
was tested using a sinusoidal wave signal and PID force tracking was tested in simulations.
